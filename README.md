# Blockfi-Case-Study
## Overview and Origin

Blockfi was founded in 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez. Blockfi is a company that in the begining the main purpose was to utilize crypto in a way that has not been done before. They began to look into the lending side of the market and realized that nobody was doing crypto backed loans. It has since released other products as well but the loan is the products that makes them stand out. How the loan works for is if someone has $20,000 in bitcoin they will lend up to 50% of the value. So they will use the bitcoin as collateral an give that client $10,000. They do not check a persons credit score to do this as long as they have the asset they will most likely get approved. Now if there asset grows in price Blockfi is only entitled to the amount of the loan. If the price is going down to where they may loose money they will liquidate the asset so they don't take a loss. This was the first product they wanted to intorduce to stand out from other companies in the crytpo market. They have since added wallets where clients can store there crypto and earn interest on it an they also have an exchange where you can buy and sell crypto. 

 Blockfi is a company that provides credit services to markets with limited accesss to products like a savings account. Blockfi can be used in different ways from being a crypto wallet to earn interest, to using crypto as collateral to borrow against.

He then began to learn about Bitcoin and started to invest in BTC in 2014. He began writing a blog all about fintech which in the begining was mostly about robo advisors and online lending (P2P) lending. After some time he became really interested in BTC because of the value and the technology behind it and how it could be used. In 2017 he began going to Bitcoin meet-ups, the meet-ups grew fast with only 10 people in the begining to hundreds over time. This was when he has the idea of Blockfi, his orginal idea was to build a debt and credit market for the crypto asset class. His business developement for Blockfi is smilar to that of the P2P lending company he worked for.

 ## Business Activites:

 ### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* One of the problems the company is trying to solve is helping people to recieve loans in a non traditional way. Instead of going to a bank to apply for a loan, if you have a crypto asset you can use that as collateral for a loan. This is really good for people with terrible credit scores since they do not check FICO scores. It is also great for people who are in parts of the world where it is nearly impossible to get a loan. In Veneszula where there currency is basically worthless getting a loan can be really hard, however if they have crypto they can use it as collateral to obtain USD. 
This was the main probelm in the begining however since it has grown and expanded it is solving more problems now than before. You can now put your crypto in a wallet to earn interest. Users can also buy, sell, or exchange different types of crypto at competative prices as well as earn interest once the trade is complete.

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customer?

*Main customer for this company are the people who own cryptocurrencies. Since there main products are accounts that pay interest on your cryto and you can borrow against your crypto. According to Businessinsider there are around 106 million people who are using cryptocurrencies worldwide. Anybody who owns crypto is able to use Blockfi. Once they come out with their credit card they will be able to expand there custoemr base. It will go from someone who has crypto to someone who doesn't need to own any, as long as they have good credit they can get approved.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?

* Since Blockfi was the first company to begin the crypto collatorized loans, it has gained an excellent reputation since it first started. They have many investors backing them are are always finding new ways to make there company stand out from the rest. They were the first company to let people use their crypto in an alternative way that just a store of value. Most people who got into crypto use used it in there portfolio or just buy low and sell high to earn gains. Blockfi's main goal was to be able to use the crypto technology as something other than a store of value. So they came up with the idea of collaterized loans backed by users crypto assets. This enables the user to use there crypto in another way that was not initally possible in the early parts of this industry. When Blockfi first started in 2017 there was not a platform to do this so once it picked up in the crypto world people and investors saw the value this could add and have been using and supporting it since.

### Which technologies are they currently using, how are they implementing them?
Blockfi is currently using cryptocurrencies to help their users earn interest, obtain loans and to buy, sell, or exchange your crypto as well. They are one of the first companies to let clients use their crypto other than a store of value. They currently use the following languages to develop all their programs and website: NGINX, HTML5, PostgreSQL, CSS 3, React, React Native, Amazon EC2, Typescript and Javascript. Using these languages helps give the customer an easy way to navigate their website and give them the most up today information. These languages also help them develop and maintain te products the currently have.
## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* Blockfi is catagorized under the cryptocurrency domain. Blockfi has only a limited amount of products right now which include a wallet you can deposit crypto in to earn interst, collaterlized crypto loans and an exhange for crypto. They are a non-bank lender which offers crypto backed loans to people who own crypto. They are also planning on releasing a credit card as well which will earn bitcoin with every purchase you make. The credit card will be the first product that comes out that you won't need any crypto to use. This will help them expand out of the cryptocurrency market to obtain more clients.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* The financial service industry has seen an enormous amount of change over the past 5-10 years. The banking industry for example has seen an rise in the kind of technology they use. Online banking has made it so most people don't even have to walk into a bank they can do most of it from their phone. Banks have systems in place where people can apply for a loan right from their computer or open a checking or savings account as well. We have also seen the cryptocurrency industry boom in the bast 5 years. There are more exchanges that have been created to buy and sell crypto, and there are more wallets that are made to store it and possibly earn interest. We are also seeing major compaies adopting crytpocurrencies which will help make them more mainstream and hopefully be used in an everyday aspect in the future.
Blockfi is developing products that you would normally see at a bank such as a savings account or a loan and has incorporated them into the crypto world. This only adds value to the crypto domain. These products let people know that there are more options on how to use there crypto. With these types of innovations they have made in the past 4 to 5 years it huge and in the next 5 to 10 years who knows what other products will be available. It is also promosing to see big companies support the crypto space as well.Tesla is a major company that has invested in Bitcoin, JPMorgan is making there own coin which is tied to the dollar but the trend is that it is becoming and everyday currency. With these compaines showing interest in crypto it should have a positive impact on the crypto world in the future. 

### What are the major companies in this domain?

* Compnaies like Blockfi are Celsius, AAVE, Blockfolio, Nexo, Coinloan, cryptop.com, Blockchain.com, Bitbond, Moneytoken.com, unchianed capital. These compaines are very similar to Blockfi however they do not have as big a reputation like Blockfi and do not have as much funding as Blockfi.

Based on everything Blockfi has done since its start it has had a huge impact on the crypto industry as well as the financial services industry.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* The main metric that companies in this industry use to measure success is how much funding they receive. Blockfi, Celcius and Hodlnanut are the top companies is this area. They all have similar products with competitive interest rates. What set these companies apart is what innovations they will come up with next. The funding from different investors will help them create more products to set themselves apart. Blockfi just received another round of funding and is looking to release a credit card product this will keep them one of the top competitors in this domain.

## Recommendations 

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offer, or use your imagination!)

* I think the company should focus on the lending side since there is more opportunity in my opinion. They could release a product that is a secured line of credit with a variable or fixed interest rate. People could use there crypto as collateral like normal but instead of getting a one time funded loan just keep it open for when they need. This could help so many people, just having that extra security option can be piece at mind. Banks do offer this but they look at FICO scores for approval. Since they do collateralized crypto loans I think this would be a good option as well. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would beneift the company?

*I think that it will give their clients another option on how to used there crypto. I think people having another way of accessing money is always a benefit. Users can have this open line of credit for whenever they need it. They can use most of it then pay it off and keep using it. Someone who doesn’t have a great FICO score this can be a powerful tool to help in an emergency. This could also help someone generate more wealth, beacuse if they have access to more money they can spend it on something that could give a great return.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* This product would utilize the crypto currency technology. The user will use the crypto they bought as collateral and given a line based on how much they are will to use. It will be like the loan however have it be open and can be used whenever is needed. 

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

* Crypto is important for this product because it is what drives the ability for Blockfi to lend without checking a FICO score.
